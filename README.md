# BBN

This repository contains my computational work for my master's thesis at IISc Bengaluru, which focuses on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). The primary objective of the work is to probe dark matter candidates using BBN as a tool.

The repository includes various computational scripts and data related to the BBN calculations performed during the research. These calculations involve studying the effects of different dark matter models on the primordial nucleosynthesis processes that occurred in the early universe.

The research work aims to contribute to the understanding of the interplay between dark matter and the cosmological evolution of the universe, specifically through the lens of BBN. It explores the implications of different dark matter scenarios and their impact on the production of light elements during the early stages of the universe.

The computational work in this repository involves numerical simulations, data analysis, and interpretation of the results obtained from the BBN calculations. The research work contributes to the broader field of cosmology and sheds light on the nature and properties of dark matter through the lens of BBN.

The repository serves as a comprehensive record of the computational work carried out during the master's thesis, providing insights into the methodology, results, and analysis related to the investigation of dark matter candidates using BBN.

Please note that the code and data in this repository are specific to my research and may not be directly applicable to other projects or studies. However, they can serve as a reference and resource for researchers working in the field of cosmology and BBN.
